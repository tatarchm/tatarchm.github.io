I am a lead research scientist at Bosch working on 3D Deep Learning.
My main focus is on company-internal projects but I do occasionally publish papers.

For the past couple of years I've been running a robotics school for kids as my main hobby project.
I generally enjoy thinking and reading about teaching, which infrequently results in some blog posts.c
