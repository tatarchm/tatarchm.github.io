I am a lead research scientist at Bosch working on 3D deep learning.
My main focus at the moment is on company-internal projects but I do occasionally [publish papers](publications.qmd).

For the past couple of years running a robotics school for kids has been my main hobby project.
I generally take great pleasure in thinking about teaching and learning, which infrequently results in some [blog](blog.qmd) posts.

Other than that, I enjoy creating music, reading and writing poetry, making stuff, and blabbering about all of those in my Russian-language TG channel.
